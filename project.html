        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Unit 1 CMU</h2>
        <div class="image-wrapper">

        <p style="text-align: center;">In this scene, I wanted to capture a tranquil beach at sunset. I used the "Rect" function to create a background filled with a gradient transitioning from orange to purple and blue, mimicking the sky and water. A large white circle with a yellow gradient filled the center, creating the sun using code. Smaller white circles added details like sunflares. The beach itself was made of two rectangles â€“ one filled with a light orange gradient and another on top with a lighter yellow gradient, creating a sense of depth. Palm trees were cleverly constructed by stacking orange polygons using the "Polygon" function.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">For the starlit sky effect, I used the "Star" function with various sizes and positions. The main character, a playful turtle, was created using a combination of shapes. Its shell was a brown polygon with a white border, defined by the "Polygon" function. Additional shapes and lines, implemented with functions like "Circle" and "Line", formed the legs, head, and details like eyes. Finally, I used "Oval" and "Polygon" functions to create some green plants, completing the beach atmosphere.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Unit 2 CMU</h2>
        <div class="image-wrapper">
            <iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/sharing/redCrocodile4909/embed"></iframe>
        </div>

        <p style="text-align: center;">The background of the animation is created using the Rect function, with a gradient transitioning from black to shades of blue to represent the vastness of space and the Earth's atmosphere. A second Rect function with a lighter orange gradient is layered on top to signify the ground that the man walks on. The planet Mars is depicted as a large Circle with an orange to red gradient, representing its rusty surface and hot core. The Star function is used to create a starry night effect, scattering gold-colored stars across the black background.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">The man himself is a simple figure constructed from basic shapes, including a white Circle for his head and a white Line for his body. When clicked, the animation triggers the onMousePress function, which rotates Mars by 15 degrees counter-clockwise and controls the visibility of different Line functions representing the man's legs and arms in various walking positions. As the man walks, a hidden counter tracks individual steps, and when it reaches 24 steps, a congratulatory message appears and another counter is incremented. When clicked again, the animation resets by making the walking position lines invisible and showing the standing position lines. An optional armstrongQuote label displays a famous quote by Neil Armstrong after a full rotation, adding a touch of nostalgia and context to the animation.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">K8 Creative Task</h2>
        <div class="image-wrapper">
            <iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/sharing/tanShark9893/embed"></iframe>
        </div>

        <p style="text-align: center;">The initial screen features a blue rectangle as the background, with three rectangles with different opacities (load1, load2, load3) and a blue oval (load4) positioned on top. These elements are initially visible, creating a visual loading bar effect. The loading screen also includes a hidden rectangle with a yellow to orange gradient (background2), a text label "Cordelious the all powerful", and several star shapes (Star) with different positions, all of which are initially hidden.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">The code defines two mouse events: onMouseMove and onMousePress. The onMouseMove function tracks mouse movement and adjusts the position of the hidden eye elements (left and right) to follow the mouse cursor, creating a following eye effect. The onMousePress function is triggered when the user clicks anywhere on the screen, hiding the initial loading screen elements (background, load1, load2, load3) and making all the hidden elements visible (k8face, wheels, microbit, microbody, BatteryWire, stars, and brawler text). This effectively transitions from the loading screen to the main screen.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">In this interactive experience, we've created a scratch that reveals the daily routine of how code is infused into our lives. We've woven together various activities, such as Face ID, social media, and more, to show how code is seamlessly integrated into our daily routines.

            Play the game to discover the surprising ways in which code influences our daily lives!</p>
