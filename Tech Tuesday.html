        Tech tuesday topic #1: 
        Computers 
        
        Raspberry pi’s are single board programming device made by the UK company Raspberry Pi foundation. They are meant to be incredibly easy devices for a range of experienced coders. Rasberry pi’s are a small and affordable computing keyboard that is often used for at home projects. People use these computers to better understand programming and generally at home projects. These computers vary from very affordable prices from $5-$100 with the goal to get all people around the world in coding. The foundations purpose is to make coding very simple and accessible for anyone that wants to learn. They obtain this by making low cost and high performance computers. 
        
        Raspberry Pi’s aren’t only limited to their basic designs as countless creative people have been able to morph simple designs into creative concepts.
        
        Here are two examples:
        
        Mini Desktop DOS PC - created by Fantasticmrdavid this project resembles an old school desktop which was achieved by placing the pi inside of a DOS PC. It’s very useful as there are multiple bases to print for different Pi models and you can have microSD replaced by a floppy drive port. I believe this to be an innovative concept as it allows you to have your custom-made old-school laptop without having to go search for one on multiple different websites. The overall idea is also a great addition to the aesthetic of your home and can be seen by other creators who may be inspired to do the same and create a business out of it.
        
        Ethernet over USB support: created by Alan, this project splits the USB port into the Ethernet and USB. This project involved designing a custom PCB from scratch. Similar to the WIZnet EVB the final result came out as a board with the same pin layout as Raspberry Pi Pico but with a few new components. It is an innovative concept as it can be used for those who don’t have their specialized board on hand. Shows that you don’t need to buy specific things when you can just create them yourselves from scratch. With this mindset, many more creators will emerge and start forming their variations of items not only expanding their mindset but the world’s because the more people do this the more influence it will have on us globally.
        
            In conclusion, Raspberry Pi devices have revolutionized the world of computing by offering affordable, accessible, and versatile tools for learning and innovation. Through projects like the Mini Desktop DOS PC and Ethernet over USB support, users can explore new ideas, learn new skills, and even turn their creations into businesses. The Raspberry Pi Foundation's commitment to making coding accessible to all has sparked a global movement of creativity and learning, inspiring people of all ages and backgrounds to delve into the world of technology and electronics. As more people continue to explore the possibilities of Raspberry Pi, we can expect to see even more innovative projects that push the boundaries of what is possible with these remarkable devices.

    <p>Tech Tuesday week 2: Hardware

        Computer hardware is the physical components of a computer. There are 2 components in hardware, internal and external hardware. External hardware are things like keyboards, monitors, printers, and scanners. In contrast, internal hardware would include RAM, motherboards, and hard drives.  
        Hard drives are the components of the computer that involves storing long term digital information. This would include all pictures, videos, music, progams, applications, and all operating systems. Every piece of information saved on a hard drive has different sizes of files. Text documents are pieces of information that include more space to store rather than videos are the largest. Additionally, hard drives include other components that are important to preface before sticking to one, such as speed. 
            For example, the samsung T7 shield which is a piece of hardware in the form of a hard drive. A hardware, that’s perfect for anyone who needs their data to be safe no matter what location they’re in.  Built to handle mildly challenging g weather elements and is great when it comes to compatibility, playing well with everything from game consoles and PCs to Macs and Android devices. When it comes to the best external hard drive you’ll want to take storage, speed, portability, compatibility, toughness, back up and security and cost into account.

    <p>Tech Tuesday #3: Artificial Intelligence

        Artficial intelligence is the computer made product that provides the user with human like responses within seconds. It processes the vast amounts of information and relays it to the user helping within, healthcare, finance, criminal justices, and other sectors of society to effecientcy of the user. The transformative power ai brings is a requirement of responsibility to the technology to be made ettiauitable and just. It has been estimated that from now to 2033 that AI will have a market share of over 744 billion dollars. Ai is being used everywhere and it is only expected to grow from now, taking over companies. Automobiles are a hidden, yet large portion of AI being developed in technology. In companies such as Tesla, they are enforcing AI chips to create an advanced self-driving feature. 
    In addition, ai is at the hands of many teens worldwide used on the platform of Snapchat. While the idea of AI seems very astonishing what has come out if so far is concerning to many individuals. Chatbots aren’t people however the more you communicate with this product, the more uncanny it feels.  Recent news suggests that the snapchat bot is able to gather photos of your house and send them to you. An individual experienced this when their chatbot glitched and posted a story of a wall and ceiling.  While the fact that it sent a random photo with no context to this user is creepy enough, the person also reveals that this seemsto match their wall and ceiling. After this the chatbot began to stop responding to users which began the question of whether the bot had gained sentience. This shows us that AI bots are growing closer to mimicking human mannerisms day by day and if this isn’t controlled it could cause something worse in the future.

    <p>Tech Tuesday #4 : Blockchains

        Blockchains are the coded protection of virtual transactions. It essentially is taking the data and storing it, controlling it, and protecting the funds to eliminate the need for banks and other third parties. Each “block” is encrypted to protect which gives it their name as “blockchains”. Within using blockchain technology within the idea of cryptocurrency it has the ability and potential to many solutions. Such as protecting medial records and preventing frudulant activity.  In essence, these blocks work to  manage their data and as the blocks grow to chnological order. To add,  blockchains bring many positives to innovations in tech and protection on cyber security and accuracy. These blockchains also allow higher efficiency as they save paper and reduces transaction costs as they have eliminated the intermediaries abd automating operations. In contrast, blockchains hace their own challenges through transaction limitations, energy consumption, and regulation concerns. As more users are using blockchains the network may find handling the data more difficult and potentially resulting in an increased transaction cost. Now with the added knowledge of what blockchain technology is learning how to apply and use it to benefit society to grow is necessary. Blockchains are found in bitcoin, banking to better trade currencies and secure loans, reducing human errors in contracts, with decentralized helps with cybersecurity to secre assets, protect patient health records, and military and other data. Blockchains are also found in NFT’s which are non-fungible tockens, which are the big reasons why copying these digital assets are not simple and protect their value which keeps a live running records over the piece. In conclusion, blockchains are a piece of innovative technology that are incredibly useful to our current day society in protection and increasing efficiency.

    <p>Tech Tuesday #5: Robotics

        “Anything humans can do in space, robots can do better” (Trevor Pagien). Robotics are a revolutionary machine since 1954 called the Ultimate. Robotics is the engineering of a produced machine that is able to replicate the actions of a human. Robots carry out the actions independently and works to accomplisk numeral tasks.
         You may have configured the idea that robots resemble humans but other options may be less ‘creepy’ and bring an ease to the consumer and interacting humans. Robots are carefully crafted to perform a wide range of tasks such as healthcare, homelife, manufacturing, logistics, military, entertainment, and travel. Healthcare is commonly known as a powerful utility of robotics in surgury and physical therapy. Homelife robots are less complex such as Roomba, or a more common robot which is alexa. Manufacturing robots are used to handle industrial tasks such as arc welding, material handling, steel cutting, and food packaging. Logistic robots are robots used to help with efficiency and helping the process of suply to the consumer at hand within a quick pace. That would include robots crafted to stack warehouse shelves, retrieve goods, and even short range deliveries. Military robots are useful to function in highly dangerous missons that would be to strainous and damahing to the average soldier. Consequently, the military has aquired a large sum of robots for a range of risky situations. For example, the Centaur, an explosive detection/disposal robot that looks for mines and IEDs, the MUTT, that follows along soldiers along with their gear. Lastly there are entertainmenr and travel robots such as robot restaurants, and self driving cars.
        During the evolution of robots their practically has increased leading to them being used for medical studies and advancements today. Physical impariments have proven to be a problem worldwide especially within children. However, just recently a Canadian tech company named Trexo Robotics released a pair of revolutionary pair of robotic legs. The way it works is with an endoskeleton that gets strapped on the user and starts walking when play is pressed. This company is known for serving families and children with living with motor disabilities like seven-year-old Jahir Ajabo who was born with cerebral palsy and has been wheelchair-bound for most of his life. His mother excepted him to be like this for his whole life but with the help of this technology Ajabos begun taking steps in a positive direction. “When you look at the market, there’s nothing serving the most impaired children,”said Schneider. “So that’s, I think, where we have a big, big opportunity to help families and help kids, just give them the opportunities that their peers have.”  With this technology many children will be able to live more fulfilling and adventurous lives, and the idea can expand and form into more advanced things in the future. 
        In conclusion, robots are performing man-made machines created to outperform human abilities through numerous difficult tasks including healthcare, homelife, manufacturing, logistics, military, entertainment, and travel.

    <p>Tech Tuesday #6: IOT 

        The term IoT, or “Internet of Things” was coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999. His image was to introduce technology to manage supply chains so that the location of the stocks at the hand would be easily monitored. 
        IOT a short abbreviation for “Internet If Things” is network of devices that connect and exchange data with IOT devices. IOT’s consist of sensors, software, mechanical and digital machines, etc. 
        IOT’s have been used by various companies to operate their devices more efficiently, deliver enhanced customer service, improve decision making, increase the productivity of businesses, and so on. IOT’s do not require physical interactions with human-to-human or human-to computer as it is transferable over a network.
        Examples of things in IOT’s include a heart monitor implant, a farm animal with a biochip transponder, an automobile that as built-in sensors to alert the driver when the tire pressure is low, and many more. By connecting to an IOT gateway devices are able to share the sensor data they collect. An IOT gateway acts as centrul hub where data is able to be sent and before it is shared it can also be sent to an edge device where that data is analyzed locally. This reduces the volume of data sent to the cloud, minimizing frequency range.
        Why is it important? Well IOT helps people live and work smarter. For example, consumers can benefit from these devices by using cars, smartwatches or thermostats which are all IOT embedded. When a person comes home their car could communicate with the garage to open the door and their thermostat can adjust to a preset temperature.
        An example of something that encompasses iot is smart farming. They are designed to help monitor crop fields using sensors and automating these systems. Using the internet of things is found incredibly useful as it allows farmers to monitor their crops and vegetation without necessarily watching over closely and using their telephones or computers.  By monitoring soil, weather, and other factors that impact the growth of crops. What makes smart farming iot by the use of robots, drones, sensors, and computer intergration analyitical tools. The data that is aquired is used for the farmers to get insight on the flaws and room for improvement. 
        Additionally, integrating IoT for farm management requires physical devices and installing the sensors and bots to record data  related to the farm only. Although using IoT is incredibly useful it requires a few things such as; high initial investment for the sensors, drones, bots, and set up, hiring trained field staff for management, connectivity to power to charge and operate, hardware maintenance costs, and continuous internet connectivity.
        In conclusion IoT technology is incredibly useful to the society we live in today, enhancing experiences and allowing easy and efficient monitoring such as smart farming.
