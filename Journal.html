  <div class="boxed-text">
    This week we continued by going to work and discover more hardware. We took apart a pc, learned about the parts that make the pc function, and 2 projects. One project we worked on was a poster based on peripherals. For the peripherals project it was a group of Rory, Sophia, and myself where we went into depth of the who, how, where, what fun facts. The rest of the class also took parts of the computer and expanded on all about how it works and the purpose of its function. This project was handed in on Friday. The second project that was making your own computer where you go through the hardware, software, operating systems, internet, and other components of how much it would cost to make your own set up with the purpose of being a certain person. Personally,i chose to be a photographer. On wednesday, we worked on CSE and attempting different challenges. This day we went over the oscillating dot and figured out using the same logic how to make an oscillating column.

  <h3 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">Week 18:</h3>  
  <div class="boxed-text">
    This week, I started our journey to learning about Artificial Intelligence (AI) in our lives and technology through CodeHs. I was excited to learn more about this fascinating topic with my group, consisting of Rory and Sophia. We began by getting in groups and conducting detective work to find an AI suspect. After some research, we discovered how AI works and its impact on our daily lives.

We completed two units within a two-week period, covering big topics such as the programming of AI, its effects on society, and the differences between conscious and logical AI. I learned that AI can be programmed to be either conscious or logical, and that the lack of consciousness in robots can have significant consequences. For example, robots without consciousness may not be able to make decisions based on moral principles or empathy.

We also explored the concept of emotional/conscious AI, such as ChatGPT, which can mimic human behaviors. The Turing Test is another important concept we discussed, which evaluates whether a machine can exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.

In addition to these topics, we learned about Figure 01, which measures the intelligence of AI robots, and the robot Andrew, which has shown signs of consciousness. This was a fascinating topic that raised many questions about the potential consequences of creating conscious machines.

Reflection

Throughout this journey, I have gained a deeper understanding of AI and its impact on our lives. I was surprised by how much I didn't know about AI before starting this course. The detective work we did at the beginning was challenging but engaging, and I enjoyed working with my group to solve the mystery.

I found the topics covered in this course to be both fascinating and thought-provoking. I never realized how much AI is already integrated into our daily lives and how it can be used for good or bad. The concept of conscious vs. logical AI has made me think about the ethics of creating intelligent machines.

Challenges and Curiosities

One challenge I faced was understanding the complex concepts of AI programming and consciousness. At times, it was difficult to wrap my head around the ideas presented in class. However, my group members were helpful in explaining things in different ways, which made it easier for me to grasp the material.

A curiosity I have is what the future holds for AI development. Will we see more conscious machines? How will this impact society? These questions are just a few examples of the many concerns and opportunities that come with advancements in AI.

Overall, this course has been an exciting journey into the world of Artificial Intelligence. I look forward to learning more about this topic and exploring its applications in various fields.

  <h3 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">Week 19:</h3>  
  <div class="boxed-text">
    This week, we continued our journey into the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with CodeHs. We started the week by presenting our projects from the previous week to the class, which was a great opportunity to share our learning with others and get feedback.

I learned about large language models (LLMs) and began exploring the world of prompt engineering. This topic fascinated me, as I had never thought about how language models are trained and how they can be used in various applications. Some of the key concepts I discovered include:

Comparing LLMs: I learned about the different types of large language models and their capabilities, such as transformer-based models like BERT and RoBERTa.
Multimodal AI: I explored the intersection of language and visual data, where AI models can learn to recognize patterns and make predictions based on both text and images.
Using AI to create a website: We learned about Gemini, a platform that uses AI to generate website content. This was a fascinating example of how AI can be used in practical applications.
In addition to these topics, I also learned about the importance of diversity and ethics in the tech industry. Some tech companies prioritize profit over these values, while others make intentional efforts to create inclusive work environments. This includes diversity training, clear anti-discrimination policies, and actively seeking diverse candidates for hiring and promotion.

The case of Timnit Gebru, a researcher who was unfairly terminated from her job at Google, highlights the challenges that advocates for ethical AI face. Her story underscores the need for companies to prioritize ethics in AI development and underscores the biases that exist in AI systems.

I also learned about the importance of diverse voices in AI development. Diverse perspectives are crucial for creating beneficial technology that benefits society as a whole. CNN is another topic I explored, which involves using AI to analyze and understand complex data.

Reflection

This week's learning has been incredibly thought-provoking. I'm amazed by the complexity of large language models and the potential applications they have in various industries. The topic of diversity and ethics in tech is also a crucial one, as it highlights the importance of intentional efforts to create inclusive environments.

Challenges and Curiosities

One challenge I faced this week was understanding the technical aspects of prompt engineering. While I have some programming experience, the concepts surrounding LLMs and multimodal AI were new to me. However, my group members were helpful in explaining things in a way that made sense to me.

A curiosity I have is what the future holds for AI development. Will we see more responsible use of AI in industries? How will companies prioritize ethics in their development processes?

To end the week, I finished unit 2 of CodeHs and spent some time gardening. It was a nice break from screens and a chance to connect with nature.

Overall, this week's learning has been engaging and informative. I'm excited to continue exploring the world of Artificial Intelligence and its applications in various fields.

<h3 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">Final Reflection</h3>  
<div class="boxed-text">
  In this course, I was introduced to key concepts and coding fundamentals from scratch, with no prior knowledge and a positive and enthusiastic attitude. We started by building our own starter websites on VSCode, and throughout the semester, we progressed to more advanced formatting and additions, culminating in this final project.

Each week, we had a 'Tech Tuesday' where we explored software, hardware, computers, cybersecurity, AI, and the Internet of Things. We also dedicated time to learning the basics of programming with binary and logic gates, which provided a solid foundation for understanding the language of computers.

Additionally, we spent several weeks working on coding exercises using Python, starting with simple tasks such as drawing shapes and colors with varying degrees of detail. On Wednesdays, we had 'CSE' sessions where we used Raspberry Pi to program lighting boards with increasingly complex tasks, from simple light control to creating intricate light shows.

Finally, we explored the world of CodeHs, delving into the concepts of AI and its current impact on our lives. We examined how AI is already transforming our world and how it will continue to shape our technological society in the future.

Overall, this course was an incredible journey that introduced me to new concepts, challenged me to think critically, adapt quickly, and take on new challenges. I'm grateful for the experience and the skills I've developed.
