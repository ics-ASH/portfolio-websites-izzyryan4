    <p>Week 1:
        We started by watching movies on coding and an introduction to the course and the resources we will use during this course. We also had a presentation from someone at Nokia.
        
        Week 2:
        This week we set up majority of the software will would use for the course, including VsCode, and our website with a login doc.
        
        Week 3: 
        We started diving into the regular course activities such as tech tuesday, CSE, and khan academy. In tech tuesday, we dived into computers and the technology involved specifically with raspberry pi. We also started with doing typing club for ten minutes every beginning of the class. We also used Khan Academy and learned about binary.
        
        Week 4:
        This week we continued with Khan Academy, CSE, and hardware in tech tuesday. We also continued with working on our websites and developing more code in HTML and ended with our Binary quiz. 
        
        Week 5:
        This week we used CMU and learned how to make images with shapes, gradients, colours, lines, opacity, and more in python.
        
        Week 6:
        March Break!!!!!
        
        Week 7:
        To add, we continued with our websites, doing tech tuesday, started CMU, and typing club. 
        
        Week 8: 
        This week we started by working on our website updates, which included adding new links, images, journal entries, and updating th etech tuesday in the selected page. Afterwards, we went into woking on tech tuesday and learning about Ai and continuing the tech tuesday with a lesson on Ai. We continued on wednesday with another day working on lighting up pixels during CSE and starting the challenges. From there, we continued learning about Ai on codeHs and finished the ethical dillema project for artificial intelligence. 
        
        Week 9:
        To continue on with this week we continued with doing the CodeHS ai lessons for unit 1.
        
        Week 10: 
        We solidified being finished with CodeHS unit 1 and started to try unit 2 in CodeHs but cancelled that after collectively finding the activity too difficult. 
        
        Week 11:
        We started going back to cs CMU for unit 2 learning about using Functions; perimeters, calling codes, debugging codes, mouse press and release events, aligning, and creating new codes encompassing the lessons. CSE we changed our set ups from using monitors to now our computers. 
        
        Week 12:
        This week we continued with CMU unit 2. Then on wednesday we continued with lighting up the pixels for raspberry piâ€™s and continuing with the challenges they gave us. Including making an oscillating dot. We ended the week by completing a Unit quiz on cmu. 
        
        Week 13: This week we continued by going to work and discover more hardware. We took apart a pc, learned about the parts that make the pc function, and 2 projects. One project we worked on was a poster based on peripherals. For the peripherals project it was a group of Rory, Sophia, and myself where we went into depth of the who, how, where, what fun facts. The rest of the class also took parts of the computer and expanded on all about how it works and the purpose of its function. This project was handed in on Friday. The second project that was making your own computer where you go through the hardware, software, operating systems, internet, and other components of how much it would cost to make your own set up with the purpose of being a certain person. Personally,i chose to be a photographer. On wednesday, we worked on CSE and attempting different challenges. This day we went over the oscillating dot and figured out using the same logic how to make an oscillating column.  
        
        Week 14: 
        This week we primarily focused on starting a new project which is k8. K8 is a small robot my group, Sanjay, Jack, and Horacio, put together. We started on tuesday by putting k8 together. On wednesday we continued with CSE and lighting up the unicorn hat. On thursday we continued to make the k8 move and drive around using microbits. We raced them, make them spin, move straight, create images and designs on the microbit, and creating sounds to play. 
        
        Week 15:
        In this week we spent our time on k8 and CSE. On monday, tuesday, thursday, and friday we worked on kate. Making it move, make noise, spin, and other controls. On Wednesday we worked on the raspberry pies and it was the last day Sammy was here. We tried pre set codes and tinkered to make the hat show. 
        
        Week 16:
        Monday we did not do anything because it was Victoria day. On tuesday we came back and worked on Tech tuesday and worked on our websites. Afterwards on wednesday we has a CSE test of signing in and working with raspberry pi without any assistance. On thursday we worked on designing k8 for the battle royal and lastly on friday we designed poster boards for the arena.
